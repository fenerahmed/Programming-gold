All of these factors determine how the climate is like in a region. Over decades, the average surface temperature in most parts around the world have been increasing at an alarming rate according to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">NASA's</a> website.

  <p>There are many different factors which can affect and contribute to global warming and impacting the climate negatively. The way climate change and global warming occurs is by the amounts greenhouse gas emmissions increasing in the Earths atmosphere leading to heat getting trapped inside and the Earth warming up (1). The gasses that are getting trapped leads to the heating of the lower atmosphere, and cooling in the upper atmosphere, creating an radius around the Earth that leads to the ozone depletion(2).
